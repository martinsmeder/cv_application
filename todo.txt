- Write the code yourself, no matter how long it takes
- Only ask chat GPT to help you understand, not to write the solution for

- Make heavy use of react documentation, to learn how to find stuff 
- Don't stress, you'll never learn if you do, count on it taking weeks (since 
  you've never worked with react before)
