==================== Principle 1: Group related state =====================
If you always update two or more state variables at the same time, 
consider merging them into a single state variable.

Exercise 1: Simple Counter
Task to perform: Create a simple counter component. When you click a "+" 
button, the counter should increment, and when you click a "-" button, it 
should decrement.

Exercise 2: Task List with Completed Status
Task to perform: Build a task list component. Each task should have a title 
and a completed status. You can mark a task as completed by clicking on it.

Exercise 3: Simple Form Validation
Task to perform: Create a form with two input fields: "Username" and 
"Password." Implement basic validation such as ensuring the password is at 
least 6 characters long.
