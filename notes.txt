Get prettier to work for JSX; 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45285339/prettier-is-not-working-at-react-project

Stick to camelCase in both html, css and js  (if possible)

Props = Arguments passed into components (think prop = object property)

Use keys when working with data (lists, arrays, objects, etc) to keep track
of things even when items are moved around, deleted, etc. Don't use index
as keys since they can change, and don't generate on the fly (like with 
Math.random()). Keys should remain.
