- Write the code yourself, no matter how long it takes
- Only ask chat GPT to help you understand, not to write the solution for 
  you 
- Make heavy use of react documentation, to learn how to find stuff 
- Don't stress, you'll never learn if you do, count on it taking weeks (since 
  you've never worked with react before)

4. Get changes in form to be displayed in cv immediately
5. Implement button to add new education (open form button)
6. Add education form 
7. Implement logic to save education  (push to array)
8. Implement logic to remove education  (remove from array)
9. Implement logic to edit education  (edit object)
10. Get changes in education form to be displayed in cv 
11. Repeat steps 5-10 for practical experience 

State needs to be added to App, so that forms and cv components can share
